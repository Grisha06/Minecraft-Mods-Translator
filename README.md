# Minecraft-Mods-Translator

 Welcome to Mods Translator!
This is a program for translating Minecraft mods written by NezertorcheaT.
To start working, select the original file with the .lang extension.
Next, enter your language in the "Lang to" field.
"Index" is the number of the line being edited.
By entering a value in the "Input Index" field and pressing the "Set Index" button, you will instantly jump to the desired line.
The button located under the translation input field is responsible for saving the data in a separate cell.
It is this cell that will subsequently be saved to a separate file.
Click this button every time you finish translating, otherwise nothing will be saved.
You can automatically use Google Translate by clicking the "Try Google Translate" button.
Finally you can save the translation file and send it to the mod creator by clicking the "Save" button.
At the moment, this is the entire functionality of the program, but it will be expanded soon.
